Overview of Smart Contracts
Definition and Functionality
A smart contract is essentially a digital agreement coded in a programming language, primarily Solidity, which is designed specifically for Ethereum. These contracts reside at a specific address on the blockchain and can execute automatically when predefined conditions are met. This automation eliminates the need for third parties, thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
Smart contracts operate under a set of rules defined in their code, which is immutable once deployed. This means that once a smart contract is on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring trust and reliability among users. They are executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which processes transactions and maintains the state of the blockchain.
Key Characteristics
Immutability: Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be changed, which protects against tampering.
Transparency: All transactions and contract terms are visible on the blockchain, promoting accountability.
Decentralization: Smart contracts operate on a peer-to-peer network, reducing reliance on centralized authorities.
Cost Efficiency: By removing intermediaries, smart contracts can significantly lower transaction costs.
Development and Deployment
To create and deploy a smart contract, developers typically follow these steps:
Write the Contract: Using Solidity, developers write the contract code that specifies its functions and conditions.
Compile the Code: The code is compiled into bytecode that the EVM can understand.
Deploy the Contract: The compiled bytecode is sent to the Ethereum network as a transaction, requiring a gas fee to process. This creates an instance of the contract on the blockchain.
Interact with the Contract: Users can interact with the deployed contract by sending transactions that trigger its functions, similar to calling an API.
